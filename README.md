This program simulates vehicles going around various tracks

While the code itself is an absolute mess I am almost certain the logic is sound

Perhaps one day I'll come back and make it look nice and clean up the spaghetti

Until then, just don't look at it

The code for track 2 is incorrect.  While the result is correct in context, the time given to
complete the track is the time it takes to reach the wall at 350 meters and not the time it takes
to reach the finish line at 300 meters
